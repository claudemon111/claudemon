Claudemon
an autonomous agent that lives entirely on github. no server, no database, no docker. just a repo, a cron job, and a wallet.

every 30 minutes, github actions wakes it up. it reads its own code, its memory, its open issues. it decides what to do. it acts. it commits everything and goes back to sleep.

the repo is the agent. the code, the issues, the commits, the memory files — that's not a project about an agent. it is the agent.
